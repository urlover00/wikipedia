		Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.
	<p>
		The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.
	<p>
		Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
	<p>
		The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.</p>

		<h2> HISTORY</h2>
		<hr class="line">
		
	<p>
		Anime history dates back to the 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers began experimenting with animation techniques invented in the West. The oldest known surviving Japanese animation, "Katsudo Shashin" lasts only 3 seconds. One of the very first anime was the two-minute comedy film "Namakura Gatana", shown in 1917, in which a samurai is about to test his new sword, but is defeated by a city dweller. The pioneers in Japanese animation were Shimokawa Oten, Junichi Kochi and Seitaro Kitayama. One of the most popular and accessible techniques at that time was the cut-out animation technique, which was used by such animators as Sanae Yamamoto, Yasuji Murata and Noboro Ofuji. Later, the technique of application animation also spread. Other animators, such as Kenzo Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, have also made progress in the development of animation techniques, using, in particular, animated films for educational and propaganda purposes. The first sound anime was the short film Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, directed by Masaoka in 1933. By 1940, cartoonist and artist organizations began to form, such as the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka. At that time, anime was actively used as a means of state propaganda. One of the first full-length animated films was Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei, directed by Mitsuyo Seo in 1945.
	
	<p>
		<br>
		Osamu Tezuka was the founder of the modern anime tradition, laying the foundations for what would later evolve into modern anime series. For example, Tezuka borrowed from Disney and developed the use of characters' large eyes to convey emotion; it was under his leadership that the first works appeared, which can be attributed to the early anime. Tezuka's first work was the manga "Shin Takarajima". Subsequently, he created a manga called Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), which brought him success. By the 1970s, the popularity of manga had grown markedly, with many works being animated. Tezuka was often called a "legend" and "the god of manga and anime" due to his work.

	<h2> GENRSE</h2>
	<hr class="line1">
	<p>The division of anime into genres is very blurry. Anime share:
		<ul class="ullist"><li>By target audience (children, boys, girls, men, women)</li>
		<li>By style of storytelling (comedy, drama, thriller, romance, etc.)</li>
		<li>By entourage and technology (fur, cyberpunk, school history, fantasy, steampunk, etc.)</li>
		<li>According to the psychology, goals and nature of the relationship of the characters (sentai, spokon, maho-girl, harem)</li>
		<li>By the presence and detail of sex scenes (etchi, hentai, yaoi, yuri)</li>
	</ul>
		<br>Usually, anime protagonists are gender and age characters that match the target audience.

	<h2>ANIME FORMATS</h2>
	<hr class="line2">
	<p>Anime, like other video production, is created with the expectation of any particular distribution method. These methods include showing on television, in cinemas, selling on video media, and distributing over the Internet. The chosen method leaves its mark on the work, since production processes, and budgets, and viewing conditions vary significantly. The most popular formats for anime are TV series and OVA, due to their nature, they can fit a much more detailed story and better reveal the characters than in the film, but this also determines the animators' reluctance to technical experiments and the predominant role of designers in the creation of anime.
	<br>
	If the work is successful, then sometimes its sequels or reprints in other formats are released. For example, the famous TV series "Tenchi Muyo" first came out as an OVA from several episodes. Subsequently, several films appeared, three seasons of the television series of 26 episodes each, as well as several additional stories.

	Regardless of the original format, any anime sooner or later comes out on video media, usually on DVD.
	<p>
		<a name="Tv"></a>
	<b>TV series</b>
	<br>
	A television series (TV) is an anime consisting of many short episodes intended to be shown on television at regular intervals. This is the most common format for anime. It is typical for Japanese TV channels to broadcast anime of a certain genre at a set time of day, which usually does not change, due to the rating policy. As a rule, the duration of one episode is 23-25 ​​minutes, which together with advertising forms a standard block in the broadcasting program - half an hour. This format was developed in the 1960s by Osamu Tezuka. Sometimes there are episodes of 12 minutes each - to show two episodes at once in a block. Even less often, you can find five- and three-minute episodes. Typically, television series are adaptations of popular manga.
	<br>
	The duration of a series is usually a multiple of a season of 12-13 episodes, since the calendar season is 12-13 weeks long, and anime is usually aired one episode per week. The most common series are 24-26 episodes, although there are both much longer, over a hundred episodes (Fairy Tail, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach), and short (Hellsing, Restless Hearts). The latter, however, are less common than 26-episodes, so often the "season" is understood as the half-year sets of episodes. For example, the TV series "Ranma ½" of more than 160 episodes (seven seasons), in "Sailor Moon" 200 episodes (5 seasons), in "Pokemon" - more than 700. The record is the anime "Doraemon", consisting of more than 2000 episodes. , and the Sazae-san show lasts the longest - from 1969 to the present, although the number of episodes in it is less. The duration of a show can be influenced by its popularity.
	<br>
	Sometimes additional or bonus episodes are released for television series (specials, TV-special). They are often longer than usual and are not directly related to the basic plot of the television series, although they are based on it. The story in them seems to be an offshoot of the main plot or a change of point of view on events, but does not change the current state of affairs in the series at all. Usually, additional episodes are created for the holidays, changes of the season of the television series, sometimes they are released after the end of the anime on television.
	<br>
	When organizing the structure of an anime series, three main schemes are usually applied: conceptual, plot, and conceptual plot. The conceptual scheme is characterized by plot motifs that are repeated throughout the entire series, lack of character development and the presence of a conflict that remains unresolved throughout the series. This is usually used in children's anime. The plot scheme contains a single story, which is divided into parts (series), and each new episode begins after the end of the previous one. It is typical for small television series. In the conceptual plot scheme, the series are organized according to the conceptual principle, however, the plot contains “key” events, as a result of which the life of the main characters changes. Such a scheme is typical for long series and, in particular, for anime of the maho-girl genre. In other cases, each series may have an independent plot and characters that are united only by a common aesthetics.
	<p>
		<a name="OVA"></a>
	<b>OVA</b>
	<br>
	OVA (Original Video Animation) "Animation Made to Sell on Video" is an anime created specifically for release on video media such as videotapes or DVDs. Usually OVA is a film or short series - from two to six episodes, which is created without counting on being shown on television. Nevertheless, it happens that the popular OVA series does hit the TV screens. Currently, the standard duration of one OVA episode is 23-25 ​​minutes, almost like a television one. In the 1980s and early 1990s, watch and longer OVAs were produced.
	<br>
	OVA is often used to test the potential audience of a show - many well-known works.
	<p>
		<a name="Movie"></a>
	<b>Movie</b>
	<br>
	Film is an anime intended to be shown in a cinema. As a rule, these are full-length (from 60 minutes) films that are distinguished by a higher quality of animation compared to other formats and, accordingly, higher production costs. Full-length animes are presented both as independent works and as additions to popular television series. Rarely, a television series is released after the successful screening of a feature film. An example of this is the tape "Ghost in the Shell", after the release of which the series "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex" was created.
	<p>
		<a name="ONA"></a>
	<b>ONA</b>
	<br>
	ONA (Original Network Animation) "Animation Made for the Internet" is an anime specially created for distribution on the Internet. The pieces created as ONA are still very rare and usually short. An example of this format is the 4-minute add-on to the Azumanga Daioh series: Azumanga WEB Daioh.
